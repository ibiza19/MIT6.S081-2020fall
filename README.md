# MIT 6.S081 2020fall
This repository contains my solution to the labs for MIT's 6.S081 operating system.

xv6 is a re-implementation of Dennis Ritchie's and Ken Thompson's Unix Version 6 (v6).  xv6 loosely follows the structure and style of v6, but is implemented for a modern RISC-V multiprocessor using ANSI C.
