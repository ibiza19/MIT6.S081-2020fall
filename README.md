# MIT 6.S081 2020fall
This repository contains my solution to the labs for MIT's 6.S081 operating system.

xv6 is a re-implementation of Dennis Ritchie's and Ken Thompson's Unix Version 6 (v6).  xv6 loosely follows the structure and style of v6, but is implemented for a modern RISC-V multiprocessor using ANSI C.

### :warning: WARNING :warning:

If you are required to write your own implementation without any unauthorized assistance, e.g. you are a MIT student currently taking this course, please do not read any of the code in this repository. This is academic integrity infringement, which is unacceptable under any circumstances.
